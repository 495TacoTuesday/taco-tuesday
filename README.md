## Considerations

- What is your product pitch?
  - It is currently impossible to see local resturaunt deals all in one place. *Deal Tracker* is the solution to that problem

- Who are the key stakeholders for this app?
  - Users of this app are anyone looking for a good deal. Additionally, they are resturaunts posting their deals on the app, or users adding resturaunt deals that they want to share with others. 

- What are the core flows?
  - The user immediately sees current deals near them on the map, as well as in a detailed tableview, both of which they can tap to see the deal in more detail.

- What will your final demo look like?
  - Our final demo will be a smooth, user friendly experience, catering to the casual user as well as those looking to promote their business online. 

- What mobile features do you leverage?
  - Our application leverages maps, for locating resturaunts, deatailed views for descriptions, and ability to lookup directions to a location.

- What are your technical concerns?
  - Storing large amounts of data accessible by everyone using the application
